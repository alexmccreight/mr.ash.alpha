Description: Fast algorithms for fitting Bayesian variable selection
    regression models, and extensions to these models. The algorithms
    are based on the variational approximations described in "Scalable
    variational inference for Bayesian variable selection in
    regression, and its accuracy in genetic association studies"
    (P. Carbonetto & M. Stephens, 2012, <DOI:10.1214/12-BA703>).
